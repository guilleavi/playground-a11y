        TODO:
        A page with images used as links changes when the user hovers over the image with a mouse. To provide keyboard users with a similar experience, the image is also changed when a user tabs to it.
        A page that allows users to click and drag items in a list to reorder them also includes a series of controls that allows keyboard users to move items up, down or to the beginning and end of the list.
        The mobile version of a web site includes a menu button that is tapped to open a site menu, which is implemented as a floating overlay. To provide access to people using external keyboards or ability switches with their mobile device, the menu button and the site menu are both implemented such that they can be operated via the mobile device's keyboard interface.

        Example 1: A drawing Program.

        A drawing program allows users to create, size, position and rotate objects from the keyboard.

        Example 2: A drag and Drop Feature.

        An application that uses drag and drop also supports "cut" and "paste" or form controls to move objects.

        Example 3: Moving between and connecting discrete points.

        A connect-the-dots program allows the user to move between dots on a screen and use the spacebar to connect the current dot to the previous one.

        Example 4: Exception - Painting Program.

        A watercolor painting program passes as an exception because the brush strokes vary depending on the speed and duration of the movements.

        Example 5: Exception - Model helicopter flight training simulator.

        A model helicopter flight training simulator passes as an exception because the nature of the simulator is to teach real-time behavior of a model helicopter.

        Example 6: A PDA with an optional keyboard

        A PDA device that is usually operated via a stylus has an optional keyboard that can be attached. The keyboard allows full Web browsing in standard fashion. The Web content is operable because it was designed to work with keyboard-only access.
