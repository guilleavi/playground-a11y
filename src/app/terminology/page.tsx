            Adaptive strategies are techniques that people with disabilities use
            to improve interaction with the web. For example, increasing the
            font size in a common browser. Adaptive strategies include
            techniques with mainstream browsers or with assistive technologies.

            Assistive technologies are software or equipment that people with
            disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. For example,
            screen readers that read aloud web pages for people who cannot read
            text, screen magnifiers for people with some types of low vision,
            and voice recognition software and selection switches for people who
            cannot use a keyboard or mouse.
